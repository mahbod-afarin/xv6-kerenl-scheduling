This project consists of two parts; in the first part, I added some system calls to xv6 to explore its structure and understand how xv6 supports processes, memory, and system calls by tracking information about them. Our new system call info(int param), takes one integer parameter with values 1, 2, or 3. If the parameter value is one, it will return the count of the process in the system. If the value is two, it will return the count of the total number of system calls that the current process has made so far. And finally, if it is three, it will return The number of memory pages the current process is using. I implemented the lottery and stride scheduling in the second part of the project. You can find more information about the implementation [here]{https://github.com/mahbod-art/xv6-kerenl-scheduling/blob/main/Report.pdf}.
